## PhD Thesis

**From Dark Matter to the Earth's Deep Interior: There and Back Again**  
Investigating inverse problem imaging and uncertainty quantification methods in global seismic tomography and cosmological mass-mapping, taking methods that are common to one field and applying them to the other.  Methods investigated include wavelet analysis, proximal algorithms and trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo.  
Supervised by Prof Ana Ferreira and Prof Thomas Kitching.

## Masters' Research

**Rayleigh Wave Ellipticity Inversion for Crustal Velocity Structure**  
Using a fully non-linear Monte Carlo inversion scheme, I invert previously collected Rayleigh wave ellipticity measurements for local **crustal** VS structure in different tectonic settings. Supervised by Dr Ana Ferreira.
