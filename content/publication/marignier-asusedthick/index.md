abstract: Around the world the Earth’s crust is blanketed to various extents by sediment. For continental regions, knowledge of the distribution and thickness of sediments is crucial for a wide range of applications including seismic hazard, resource potential, and our ability to constrain the deeper crustal geology. Excellent constraints on the sediment thickness can be obtained from borehole drilling or active seismic surveys. However, these approaches are expensive and impractical in remote continental interiors such as central Australia. Recently, a method for estimating the sediment thickness using passive seismic data, the collection of which is relatively simple and low-cost, was developed and applied to seismic stations in South Australia. This method uses receiver functions, specifically the time delay of the P-to-S converted phase generated at the sediment-basement interface, relative to the direct-P arrival, to generate a first order estimate of the thickness of sediments. In this work we expand the analysis to the vast array of over 1500 seismic stations across Australia, covering an entire continent and numerous sedimentary basins that span the entire range from Precambrian to present-day. We compare with an established yet separate method to estimate the sediment thickness, which utilises the autocorrelation of the radial receiver functions to ascertain the two-way travel-time of shear waves reverberating in a sedimentary layer. Across the Australian continent the new results match the broad pattern of expected sedimentary features based on the various geological provinces. We are able to delineate the boundaries of many sedimentary basins, such as the Eucla and Murray Basins, which are Cenozoic, and the boundary between the Karumba Basin and the mineral rich Mount Isa Province. Contrasts in seismic delay time across these boundaries are upwards of 0.4 s. The delay signal is found to diminish to <0.1 s for older Proterozoic basins, likely due to compaction and metamorphism of the sediments over time. As an application of the method, a comparison with measurements of sediment thickness from local boreholes allows for a straightforward predictive relationship between the delay time and the cover thickness to be defined. This offers future widespread potential, providing a simple and cheap way to characterise the sediment thickness in under-explored areas from passive seismic data.
