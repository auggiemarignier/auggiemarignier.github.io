I am a postdoc in the Seismology & Mathematical Geophysics group at RSES at ANU, currently looking at characterising the sedimentary thickness across Australia using passive seismic methods.

I completed my PhD in Data Intensive Science at UCL in 2022.  My research focused on solving large-scale inverse imaging problems using probabilistic methods, applied to seismological and cosmological problems.
