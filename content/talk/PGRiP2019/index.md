abstract: "Seismic tomography has seen a significant improvement since the end of the twentieth century with the
expansion of seismic station networks and theoretical and computational advances leading to more and
more detailed models of the Earthâ€™s deep interior. While features such as subduction zones are relatively
easy to image, other features such as mantle plumes continue to be difficult to resolve. Furthermore,
differences in datasets, theory and methods used to build tomographic models result in different features
appearing inconsistently, and a lack of uncertainty quantification impedes distinguishing features from
noise. This work uses a spherical wavelet transform and random noise realisations to objectively quantify
the probability of plume-like features in six recent global tomographic models. We find only two features,
in the Pacific and East Africa, that consistently and confidently appear in at least five models. Hawaii and
Iceland plumes are found in only up to two models, as are plumes around the Southwest and Southeast
Indian ridges. From this we conclude that great care must be taken when visually interpreting plume-like
features in tomographic models, as few can be clearly distinguished from noise or small-scale artefacts.
Additionally, high correlations are found between plume probability maps and shear wave speed within
the boundary of large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) at the core-mantle-boundary in all models,
reinforcing the notion that some plumes may be rooted at the LLSVPs. While the focus of this work is on
mantle plumes, the tool developed to examine tomography models is flexible and can be used to assess
other features of the tomographic models."
