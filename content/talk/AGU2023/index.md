abstract: "Finding new mineral deposits hidden beneath the sedimentary cover of Australia has become a national priority, given the countryâ€™s economic dependence on natural resources and urgent demand for critical minerals for a sustainable future. A fundamental first step in finding new deposits is to characterise the depth of sedimentary cover. Excellent constraints on the sedimentary thickness can be obtained from borehole drilling or active seismic surveys. However, these approaches are expensive and impractical in the remote regions of Australia. With over three quarters of the continent being covered in sedimentary and unconsolidated material, this poses a significant challenge to exploration.
Recently, a method for estimating the sedimentary thickness using passive seismic data, the collection of which is relatively simple and low-cost, was developed and applied to seismic stations in South Australia. The method uses receiver functions, specifically the delay time of the P-to-S converted phase generated at the interface of the sedimentary basement, relative to the direct-P arrival, to generate a first order estimate of the thickness of sedimentary cover. In this work we apply the same method to the vast array of seismic stations across Australia, using data from broadband stations in both permanent and temporary networks. We also investigate using the two-way traveltime of shear waves, obtained from the autocorrelation of radial receiver functions, as a related yet separate estimate of sedimentary thickness.

From the new receiver function delay time and autocorrelation results we are able to identify many features, such as the relatively young Cenozoic Eucla and Murray Basins. Older Proterozoic regions show little signal, likely due to the strong compaction of sediments. A comparison with measurements of sedimentary thickness from local boreholes gives a straightforward predictive relationship between the delay time and the cover thickness, offering a simple and cheap way to characterise the sedimentary thickness in unexplored areas from passive seismic data. This study and some of the data used are funded and supported by the Australian Government's Exploring for the Future program led by Geoscience Australia."
