Inverse imaging problems defined on the sphere arise in many fields, including seismology and cosmology where images are defined on the globe and the cosmic sphere, and are generally high-dimensional and computationally expensive. As a result, sampling the posterior distribution of spherical imaging problems is a challenging task. Our framework leverages a proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to efficiently sample the high-dimensional space of spherical images with a sparsity-promoting wavelet prior. We detail the modifications needed for the algorithm to be applied to spherical problems, and give special consideration to the crucial forward modelling step which contains computationally expensive spherical harmonic transforms. By sampling the posterior, our framework allows for full and flexible uncertainty quantification, something which is not possible with other methods based on, for example, convex optimisation. We demonstrate our framework in practice on full-sky cosmological mass-mapping and to the construction of phase velocity maps in global seismic tomography. We find that our approach is potentially useful at moderate resolutions, such as those of interest in seismology. However at high resolutions, such as those required for astrophysical applications, the poor scaling of the complexity of spherical harmonic transforms severely limits our method, which may be resolved with future GPU implementations. A new Python package, pxmcmc, containing the proximal MCMC sampler, measurement operators, wavelet transforms and sparse priors is made publicly available.","tags":[],"title":"Posterior sampling for inverse imaging problems on the sphere in seismology and cosmology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

Amplification measurements have narrower depth sensitivity when compared to more traditional seismic observables such as surface wave dispersion measurements. In particular, we take advantage of the strong sensitivity of Love wave amplification measurements to the crust. We invert over 6,400 multi-frequency measurements using the Monte-Carlo based Neighbourhood Algorithm, which allows for uncertainty quantification. SWUS-crust confirms several features observed in previous models, such as high-velocity anomalies beneath the Columbia basin and low-velocity anomalies beneath the Basin and Range province.

Recent tomography studies suggest that we are now starting to resolve deep mantle plume structures. However, a lack of uncertainty quantification impedes a full assessment of their significance and whether they are statistically distinct from noise. This work uses a spherical wavelet transform and random noise realizations to quantify the probability of deep plume-like features in six recent global tomographic models. We find that out of 50 possible mantle deep plumes, 12 are highly likely, with probabilities larger than 80%, and 12 are likely, with probability between 70% and 80%. Objective, quantitative approaches as proposed in this study should be used for model interpretation. The five most likely deep mantle plumes are Tahiti, Macdonald, East Africa, Pitcairn, and Marquesas, which have some of the largest buoyancy fluxes estimated in a previous study that used hotspot swell volumes. This could resolve past discrepancies between deep mantle plumes inferred by visual analysis of tomography models and flux estimations from hotspot swell data. In addition, a notable unlikely deep mantle plume is Yellowstone, with probability lower than 50%. We also identify a likely deep mantle plume associated with the Amsterdam-St Paul hotspot, a region scarcely discussed in previous studies and that deserves future investigation. Hence, our automated, objective approach is a valuable alternative approach for the quantitative interpretation of tomographic models.","tags":[],"title":"The Probability of Mantle Plumes in Global Tomographic Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

The Azores Archipelago is located near a triple junction system and is possibly under the influence of a mantle plume, being at the locus of a wide range of geodynamic processes. However, its crustal structure is still poorly constrained and debated due to the limited seismic coverage of the region and the peculiar linear geometry of the islands. To address these limitations, in this study we invert teleseismic Rayleigh wave ellipticity measurements for 1-D shear wave speed (VS) crustal models of the Azores Archipelago. Moreover, we test the reliability of these new models by using them in independent moment tensor inversions of local seismic data and demonstrate that our models improve the waveform fit compared to previous models. We find that data from the westernmost seismic stations used in this study require a shallower Moho depth (∼10 km) than data from stations in the eastern part of the archipelago (∼13–16 km). This apparent increase in the Moho depth with increasing distance from the mid-Atlantic ridge (MAR) is expected. However, the rate at which Moho deepens away from the MAR is greater than that predicted from a half-space cooling model, suggesting that local tectonic perturbations have modified crustal structure. The 1-D VS models obtained beneath the westernmost seismic stations also show higher wave speeds than for the easternmost stations, which correlates well with the ages of the islands except Santa Maria Island. We interpret the relatively low VS profile found beneath Santa Maria Island as resulting from underplating, which agrees with previous geological studies of the island. Compared to a recent receiver function study of the region, the shallow structure (top ∼2 km) in our models shows lower shear wave speed, which may have important implications for future hazard studies of the region. More generally, the new seismic crustal models we present in this study will be useful to better understand the tectonics, seismicity, moment tensors and strong ground motions in the region.","tags":[],"title":"Crustal structure of the Azores Archipelago from Rayleigh wave ellipticity data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575936e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575936e3,"objectID":"23bbc2de017629cf88fd53844db4cc06","permalink":"https://auggiemarignier.github.io/talk/agu2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/agu2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Seismic tomography has seen a significant improvement since the end of the twentieth century with the expansion of seismic station networks and theoretical and computational advances leading to more and more detailed models of the Earth's deep interior.
