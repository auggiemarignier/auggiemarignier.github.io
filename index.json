For continental regions, knowledge of the distribution and thickness of sediments is crucial for a wide range of applications including seismic hazard, resource potential, and our ability to constrain the deeper crustal geology. Excellent constraints on the sediment thickness can be obtained from borehole drilling or active seismic surveys. However, these approaches are expensive and impractical in remote continental interiors such as central Australia. Recently, a method for estimating the sediment thickness using passive seismic data, the collection of which is relatively simple and low-cost, was developed and applied to seismic stations in South Australia. This method uses receiver functions, specifically the time delay of the P-to-S converted phase generated at the sediment-basement interface, relative to the direct-P arrival, to generate a first order estimate of the thickness of sediments. In this work we expand the analysis to the vast array of over 1500 seismic stations across Australia, covering an entire continent and numerous sedimentary basins that span the entire range from Precambrian to present-day. We compare with an established yet separate method to estimate the sediment thickness, which utilises the autocorrelation of the radial receiver functions to ascertain the two-way travel-time of shear waves reverberating in a sedimentary layer. Across the Australian continent the new results match the broad pattern of expected sedimentary features based on the various geological provinces. We are able to delineate the boundaries of many sedimentary basins, such as the Eucla and Murray Basins, which are Cenozoic, and the boundary between the Karumba Basin and the mineral rich Mount Isa Province. Contrasts in seismic delay time across these boundaries are upwards of 0.4 s. The delay signal is found to diminish to \u003c0.1 s for older Proterozoic basins, likely due to compaction and metamorphism of the sediments over time. As an application of the method, a comparison with measurements of sediment thickness from local boreholes allows for a straightforward predictive relationship between the delay time and the cover thickness to be defined. This offers future widespread potential, providing a simple and cheap way to characterise the sediment thickness in under-explored areas from passive seismic data.","tags":[],"title":"Sediment thickness across Australia from passive seismic methods","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1703030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1703030400,"objectID":"6b4a39ae01a8a657c98d30323f51ea77","permalink":"https://auggiemarignier.github.io/talk/agu2023/","publishdate":"2023-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/agu2023/","section":"talk","summary":"Finding new mineral deposits hidden beneath the sedimentary cover of Australia has become a national priority, given the country’s economic dependence on natural resources and urgent demand for critical minerals for a sustainable future.

In an expanding Universe the existence of causally separate regions prevents such symmetries from being broken uniformly, with a network of cosmic string inevitably forming as a result. To faithfully generate observables of such processes requires computationally expensive numerical simulations, which prohibits many types of analyses. We propose a technique to instead rapidly emulate observables, thus circumventing simulation. Emulation is a form of generative modelling, often built upon a machine learning backbone. End-to-end emulation often fails due to high dimensionality and insufficient training data. Consequently, it is common to instead emulate a latent representation from which observables may readily be synthesised. Wavelet phase harmonics are an excellent latent representations for cosmological fields, both as a summary statistic and for emulation, since they do not require training and are highly sensitive to non-Gaussian information. Leveraging wavelet phase harmonics as a latent representation, we develop techniques to emulate string induced CMB anisotropies over a 7.2 degree field of view, with sub-arcminute resolution, in under a minute on a single GPU. Beyond generating high fidelity emulations, we provide a technique to ensure these observables are distributed correctly, providing a more representative ensemble of samples. The statistics of our emulations are commensurate with those calculated on comprehensive Nambu-Goto simulations. Our findings indicate these fast emulation approaches may be suitable for wide use in, e.g., simulation based inference pipelines. We make our code available to the community so that researchers may rapidly emulate cosmic string induced CMB anisotropies for their own analysis.","tags":[],"title":"Fast emulation of anisotropies induced in the cosmic microwave background by cosmic strings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["W.

The appeal of MCMC in the physical sciences is that it produces a set of samples from the posterior distribution of model parameters given the available data, integrating any prior information one may have about the parameters and providing a fully flexible way to quantify uncertainty.  However, it is well known that in high dimensions (many model parameters) standard MCMC struggles to converge to a solution due the exponentially large space to be sampled.  This led to the development of gradient-based MCMC algorithms, which use the gradient of the posterior distribution to efficiently navigate the parameter space.  While this allows MCMC to scale to high dimensions, it restricts the form of the posterior to be continuously differentiable.  Certain forms of prior information used in imaging problems, such as sparsity, use a non-smooth prior distribution, thus gradient-based MCMC cannot be used for these inference problems.

What is the universe made of? These are arguably two of the biggest questions asked by anyone from young children to senior scientists. Unfortunately, direct observations of the answer to either question are diﬀicult to come by. We can only dig so far down into the crust, and only fly so far out into space. As such, we must infer the answers to these questions from their effects on other observable systems. This is what is known as an inverse problem. In this presentation I investigate methods used to solve the inverse problems of imaging the Earth’s deep interior and mapping the distribution of dark matter in the universe. I investigate whether the methods used for one problem are transferrable to the other, creating a transfer of knowledge between the fields of geophysics and astrophysics, aiming to substantially advance imaging methods and uncertainty quantification in both fields. My focus is on probabilistic methods, that is to say methods which solve the inverse problem by drawing millions of images according probability distributions in a Bayesian manner. The key benefit of these methods is that they lend themselves naturally to full uncertainty quantification, with the drawback of being extremely slow particularly as the resolution of the images increases. First, I create new images of the upper-most mantle and their associated uncertainties using a sparsity-promoting wavelet prior and an advanced probabilistic inversion scheme. This particular scheme is designed to improve con- vergence in high-dimensional and non-smooth parameter spaces. These new images exhibit the expected tectonic features such as plate boundaries and continental cratons. Importantly, the uncertainties obtained are physically reasonable and informative, in that they reflect the heterogenous data distribution and also highlight artefacts due to an incomplete forward model. These inversions are a first step towards building a fully probabilistic upper-mantle model in a sparse wavelet basis. I then apply the same advanced probabilistic method to the problem of full-sky cosmological mass-mapping. However, this is severely limited by the computational complexity of high-resolution spherical harmonic transforms. In response to this, I use, for the first time in cosmology, a trans-dimensional algorithm to build galaxy cluster-scale mass- maps. This new approach performs better than the standard mass-mapping method, with the added benefit that uncertainties are naturally recovered. With more accurate mass-maps and uncertainties, this method will be a valuable tool for cosmological inference with the new high-resolution data expected from upcoming galaxy surveys, potentially providing new insights into the interactions of dark matter particles in colliding galaxy cluster systems.","tags":[],"title":"Probabilistic inverse imaging methods in seismology and cosmology","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1687910400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687910400,"objectID":"a8c1b1ff77ffb5e2002748928ec1e3f6","permalink":"https://auggiemarignier.github.io/talk/aesc2023/","publishdate":"2023-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/aesc2023/","section":"talk","summary":"Finding new mineral deposits hidden beneath the sedimentary cover of Australia has become a national priority, given the country’s economic dependence on natural resources and urgent demand for critical minerals for a sustainable future.

Inverse imaging problems defined on the sphere arise in many fields, including seismology and cosmology where images are defined on the globe and the cosmic sphere, and are generally high-dimensional and computationally expensive. As a result, sampling the posterior distribution of spherical imaging problems is a challenging task. Our framework leverages a proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to efficiently sample the high-dimensional space of spherical images with a sparsity-promoting wavelet prior. We detail the modifications needed for the algorithm to be applied to spherical problems, and give special consideration to the crucial forward modelling step which contains computationally expensive spherical harmonic transforms. By sampling the posterior, our framework allows for full and flexible uncertainty quantification, something which is not possible with other methods based on, for example, convex optimisation. We demonstrate our framework in practice on full-sky cosmological mass-mapping and to the construction of phase velocity maps in global seismic tomography. We find that our approach is potentially useful at moderate resolutions, such as those of interest in seismology. However at high resolutions, such as those required for astrophysical applications, the poor scaling of the complexity of spherical harmonic transforms severely limits our method, which may be resolved with future GPU implementations.

We show that these developments allow the construction of more expressive hybrid models that achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and parameter efficiency on spherical benchmark problems.","tags":[],"title":"Efficient Generalized Spherical CNNs","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1612224e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612224e3,"objectID":"1051a916bad1561e0027a414a102b9fd","permalink":"https://auggiemarignier.github.io/talk/ssavt2021/","publishdate":"2021-02-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ssavt2021/","section":"talk","summary":"Probabilistic sampling methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are a popular way to sample the posterior probability density function of an inverse problem. They are common in seismic tomography on local and regional scales, however they struggle on global scales where the dimensionality of the problem is typically much higher. The appeal of these methods for tomography is twofold: they allow for full uncertainty quantification and can solve non-linear inverse problems. Solutions to high-dimensional problems include the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method, which uses the gradient of the posterior to guide the sampling search. Unfortunately, this prohibits using non-smooth priors such as the Laplace distribution which promotes sparsity. Sparse image reconstructions have been shown to be able to recover both sharp and smooth features, even in underdetermined systems or when data are poorly distributed, the latter of which is a common scenario in seismic tomography.\nIn this work we use a recent proximal MCMC algorithm to build global fundamental mode Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps. Proximal MCMC leverages proximal calculus to allow non-differentiable priors in a high-dimensional inversion. As such, we adopt a sparsity-promoting prior, promoting sparsity in a spherical wavelet basis. We perform synthetic experiments and compare our results to those of a typical linear least-squares inversion. Finally, we discuss the future possibilities of building a 3D Earth model with uncertainties using a similar wavelet parameterised proximal MCMC approach.","tags":[],"title":"Proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo: Towards building a sparse Earth model","type":"talk"},{"authors":["A.

Recent tomography studies suggest that we are now starting to resolve deep mantle plume structures. However, a lack of uncertainty quantification impedes a full assessment of their significance and whether they are statistically distinct from noise. This work uses a spherical wavelet transform and random noise realizations to quantify the probability of deep plume-like features in six recent global tomographic models. We find that out of 50 possible mantle deep plumes, 12 are highly likely, with probabilities larger than 80%, and 12 are likely, with probability between 70% and 80%. Objective, quantitative approaches as proposed in this study should be used for model interpretation. The five most likely deep mantle plumes are Tahiti, Macdonald, East Africa, Pitcairn, and Marquesas, which have some of the largest buoyancy fluxes estimated in a previous study that used hotspot swell volumes. This could resolve past discrepancies between deep mantle plumes inferred by visual analysis of tomography models and flux estimations from hotspot swell data. In addition, a notable unlikely deep mantle plume is Yellowstone, with probability lower than 50%. We also identify a likely deep mantle plume associated with the Amsterdam-St Paul hotspot, a region scarcely discussed in previous studies and that deserves future investigation. Hence, our automated, objective approach is a valuable alternative approach for the quantitative interpretation of tomographic models.","tags":[],"title":"The Probability of Mantle Plumes in Global Tomographic Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

The Azores Archipelago is located near a triple junction system and is possibly under the influence of a mantle plume, being at the locus of a wide range of geodynamic processes. However, its crustal structure is still poorly constrained and debated due to the limited seismic coverage of the region and the peculiar linear geometry of the islands. To address these limitations, in this study we invert teleseismic Rayleigh wave ellipticity measurements for 1-D shear wave speed (VS) crustal models of the Azores Archipelago. Moreover, we test the reliability of these new models by using them in independent moment tensor inversions of local seismic data and demonstrate that our models improve the waveform fit compared to previous models. We find that data from the westernmost seismic stations used in this study require a shallower Moho depth (∼10 km) than data from stations in the eastern part of the archipelago (∼13–16 km). This apparent increase in the Moho depth with increasing distance from the mid-Atlantic ridge (MAR) is expected. However, the rate at which Moho deepens away from the MAR is greater than that predicted from a half-space cooling model, suggesting that local tectonic perturbations have modified crustal structure. The 1-D VS models obtained beneath the westernmost seismic stations also show higher wave speeds than for the easternmost stations, which correlates well with the ages of the islands except Santa Maria Island. We interpret the relatively low VS profile found beneath Santa Maria Island as resulting from underplating, which agrees with previous geological studies of the island. Compared to a recent receiver function study of the region, the shallow structure (top ∼2 km) in our models shows lower shear wave speed, which may have important implications for future hazard studies of the region. More generally, the new seismic crustal models we present in this study will be useful to better understand the tectonics, seismicity, moment tensors and strong ground motions in the region.","tags":[],"title":"Crustal structure of the Azores Archipelago from Rayleigh wave ellipticity data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575936e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575936e3,"objectID":"23bbc2de017629cf88fd53844db4cc06","permalink":"https://auggiemarignier.github.io/talk/agu2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/agu2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Seismic tomography has seen a significant improvement since the end of the twentieth century with the expansion of seismic station networks and theoretical and computational advances leading to more and more detailed models of the Earth's deep interior.
